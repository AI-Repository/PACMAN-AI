# PACMAN-AI

The aim of this project is to develop an **Purelly Reactive Agent** to provide the best software controller for the game of *Ms Pac-Man*. The Agent acts **independed** in is enviroment with their sensors and actuators. Read this paper for more detailed [information](https://github.com/IA-Repository/PACMAN-Reactive-Agents/blob/master/paper.pdf)

I'm currently also working on aplying the classic MCTS for this domain!

Pac-Man is a classic, an non-deterministic game, and rather difficult for most human players. As far as we know, nobody really knows how hard it is to develop an AI player for the game.
